# Nansen_Legacy_template_generator

The Nansen Legacy template generator is designed based on experiences gained during the Nansen Legacy project (Arven etter Nansen - AeN). This template generator will be used to create spreadsheet templates that include columns based on both the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions and Darwin Core.

CF Conventions: https://cfconventions.org/
Darwin Core: https://dwc.tdwg.org/

A separate sheet in the same file includes space to fill in global attributes based on CF and the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD).

ACDD: https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3

The global attributes recommendations used in this template generator are in line with the recommendations for CF-NetCDF files that contribute to SIOS, as documented here:
